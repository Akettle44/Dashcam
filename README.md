#DIYDashcam

This is a DIY personal dashcam using a Beaglebone and a Logitech C920. The code is brief and consists of OpenCV, V4L2, and FFMPEG currently running on Elementary OS 5.0 Juno and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver. I am using this as an introduction to embedded systems and wanted to expand this to eventually use a dnn for image processing.

The bulk of this project consisted of toolchain and setting my enviornment properly, which proved to be quite a struggle so I am hoping to make it easier for the next person!

Basic Hardware:

BeagleBone Black
Ethernet Cable
Mini USB Cable
8 GB (minimum) SD Card

Basic Software: 

Ubuntu / Debian (haven't tested on Debian)
OpenCV 4.0
FFMPEG 4.1.3
V4L2
